This repository contains all the codes used for Legay et al. "A generic framework for evaluating the oceanic mixed layer depth dynamics". 
It includes the Jupyter Notebook used for performing the 1D simulations and all the analyses, the 1D model as a Fortran Module "scm-oce.so", and the Fortran codes needed for generating this module. 
The eORCA1, eORCA1GM, eORCA12 and eNATL60 simulations outputs needed for realizing the figures are available as "npz" archives via the following DOI: \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7944781}.
